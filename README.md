# My Kattis' submissions

The [Kattis Problem Archive](https://open.kattis.com/) is a platform where you can find hundreds of programming problems to solve.

- I prefer Kattis over HackerRank, LeetCode and other similar platforms, specially because Kattis does not force one to use an online code editor, but to rather submit the actual code file.

- This repository will host the code for the problems. Each problem has a specific directory with its name to hosts the code used to solve it. Only the `main.rs` file is uploaded to Kattis, the remaining code is boilerplate generated from `cargo new`.
